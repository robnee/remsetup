Scripts for building and configuring Raspbian for Lirc remote control

Starting remsetup project to attempt to write a set of scripts to build and config a Raspbian image for use as a remote box.  This will probably include these things

- Raspbian Lite image
- Configure wifi and headless build via ssh
- configure raspi-config settings
- Update OS
- configure lirc

- Add packages
   1. Python
   2. lirc

## Setup

### Set credentials using

	. vars

### Use prep.sh to flash and config

Boot

### Run sudo raspi-config:

1. Change password
2. Change hostname
4. Change locale timezone keyboard wifi-country
7. Change Memory split

## potential for automation:

### /etc/hostname file:

Add host name. todo: what does raspi-config do when changing locale?

### Append /boot/config.txt

	"gpu_mem=16"


	add "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" to /etc/locale.gen

### create /etc/timezone

	US/Eastern

### /etc/default/locale

	#  File generated by update-locale
	LANG=C.UTF-8

### /etc/default/keyboard

	# KEYBOARD CONFIGURATION FILE

### Consult the keyboard(5) manual page.  Todo: compare raw file with file after raspi-config

	XKBMODEL="pc101"
	XKBLAYOUT="us"
	XKBVARIANT=""
	XKBOPTIONS="lv3:ralt_alt"
	
	BACKSPACE="guess"

## Installing Packages

	sudo apt-get -y update
	sudo apt-get -y upgrade
	
	sudo apt-get -y install lirc
	sudo apt-get -y install subversion
	sudo apt-get -y install git


## Lirc Setup

### add to /boot/config.txt:

	dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=23,gpio_out_pin=22,gpio_in_pull=up

### add to /etc/modules:

	lirc_dev
	lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22

### update /etc/lirc/hardware.conf

We are only sending IR commands.  we don't need to enable or config any of the IR receive services.  We also want the Lirc daemon  to listen for commands to send on its local port.

	# /etc/lirc/hardware.conf
	#
	# Arguments which will be used when launching lircd
	# todo: look up the meaning of --listen and document here
	#LIRCD_ARGS="--uinput"
	LIRCD_ARGS="--listen"
	
	# Don't start lircmd even if there seems to be a good config file
	# START_LIRCMD=false
	
	# Don't start irexec, even if a good config file seems to exist.
	# START_IREXEC=false
	
	# Try to load appropriate kernel modules
	LOAD_MODULES=true
	
	# Run "lircd --driver=help" for a list of supported drivers.
	# todo: what does this option do?
	DRIVER="default"
	# usually /dev/lirc0 is the correct setting for systems using udev
	DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
	MODULES="lirc_rpi"
	
	# Default configuration files for your hardware if any
	LIRCD_CONF=""
	LIRCMD_CONF=""

### Reboot

Much frustration can be avoided be rebooting before testing

## Troubleshooting

### Check for syslog errors

Fix bug in /etc/rsyslog.conf to no longer refer to xconsole to prevent annoying syslog errors for headless systems not running an X desktop.  This may no longer be necessary in Stretch onward.

The parameters in /etc/modules for lirc_rpi seem to cause an error message in /var/log/syslog:

	Mar 19 10:36:54 raspberrypi systemd-modules-load[89]: Inserted module 'lirc_dev'
	Mar 19 10:36:54 raspberrypi systemd-modules-load[89]: Failed to find module 'lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22'

It's possible that since these options are now specified in the /boot/config.txt file that they aren't even necessary.  I excluded them on the zero and it seems to still work and the message goes away.

So for the Pi Zero W the config options are as follows.  Since we aren't using the receiver don't list it. 

/boot/config.txt:

	# Uncomment this to enable the lirc-rpi module
	dtoverlay=lirc-rpi
	dtparam=gpio_out_pin=22

 Edit to /etc/modules:

	lirc_dev
	lirc_rpi

### random send failures

Seemingly at random irsend will stop working yet not complain.  The pin will work but irsend will stop sending.  A couple of people in various forums recommend adding the explicit socket command to the irsend command.  i.e.:

	irsend -d /var/run/lirc/lircd send_once AA59 KEY_VOLUMEUP

Todo: is this still an issue?


## test IR receive

	sudo /etc/init.d/lirc stop
	mode2 -d /dev/lirc0


## Create Lirc .conf file

See projects/lirc for info on coding lircd.conf files.  It's also possible to create a file by recording IR commands.

### Stop lirc to free up /dev/lirc0

	sudo /etc/init.d/lirc stop

### Create a new remote control configuration file (using irrecord) to ~/lircd.conf

	irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/lircd.conf

### Make a backup of the original lircd.conf file

	sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd_original.conf

### Copy over your new configuration file

	sudo cp ~/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf

### Start up lirc again

	sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start
	sudo service lirc start
	sudo /etc/init.d/lirc status

### list all commands

Note the empty quoted string as placeholder for (required) key argument.

	irsend list /home/pi/lircd.conf ""

## Test IR Send

	irsend send_once <device> <key>

	$ irsend SEND_ONCE <device-name> KEY_POWER
	$ irsend SEND_ONCE <device-name> KEY_VOLUMEUP

## Config application

	svn checkout svn://server/home/Shared/repository/projects


# Setting up remote with stretch on a Raspberry Pi Zero W

## Setting up the Raspbian SD card

Download the current Lite version of Raspbian from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads.  The Lite version is smaller and does not include a desktop which is not needed for a headless box.  Copy the image to a micro SD card of at least 4GB.  You can't just copy it to the card.  You want to reimage the card itself using the Raspbian boot image.  There are instructions for WIndowns if you follow the links from the downloads page.

For Linux use /proc/partitions and/or /dev to locate the device with the SD card,  If the card does not appear then try unplugging and replugging the card reader itself.

	cat /proc/partitions
	ls /dev
	dd if=2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img of=/dev/sdx bs=64K

We need to add some files to the boot partition to permit Raspbian to boot headless and connect to the LAN wirelessly.  Windows should mount the first partition (which is formatted FAT) automatically.

For Linux mount the drive for in RW mode:

	sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdx1 /mnt/disk -o rw,umask=0000

Add two files.  An empty file named `ssh` and a file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with the SSID and password of the wireless access point to connect to:

	cd /mnt/disk
	cat > wpa_supplicant.conf
	network={
	  ssid=
	  psk=
	}

Unmount or eject the SD card.

	cd /mnt
	sudo umount /mnt/disk


### First Boot

Run /boot/tools/config.sh

Notes to make IR shield (made by LinkSprite) work in Raspberry Pi 3 (bought from Amazon [1]). 
The vendor has some documentation [2] but that is not complete and sufficient for Raspbian Stretch. 
Following are the changes that I made to make it work.

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install lirc

### Update the following line in /boot/config.txt

	dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=18,gpio_out_pin=17

### Add the following lines to /etc/modules file

	lirc_dev
	_rpi gpio_in_pin=18 gpio_out_pin=17


### Add the following lines to /etc/lirc/hardware.conf file

	LIRCD_ARGS="--uinput --listen"
	LOAD_MODULES=true
	DRIVER="default"
	DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
	MODULES="lirc_rpi"

### Update the following lines in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf

	# todo: what does this do?
	driver    = default
	device    = /dev/lirc0

	$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start
